# Computer-Vision-Notes

This repo will contain notes for CV-related Papers and Knowledge.

Computer Vision Tasks can be roughly divided into two parts. The one is high-level tasks and the other is low-level tasks.

High-level tasks include image recognition, image classification, video understanding and analysis, semantic segmentation and so on. Low-level tasks include image restoration, image enhancement, image denoising, image deblurring, image super resolution and so on. For high-level tasks, we need to let computers think like human. They need to analyze the images or videos. For low-level tasks, implementations are like Digital Image Processing. We focus more on image quality and we may concentrate less on figuring out what is included in an image or video.

Here are a list of TOP Conferences and Transactions in CV field.

TOP Conferences: CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NIPS, ICML, ICLR

TOP Transactions: IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TIP
