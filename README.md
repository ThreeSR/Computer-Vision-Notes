# Computer-Vision-Notes

This repo will contain notes for CV-related Papers and Knowledge.

Computer Vision Tasks can be roughly divided into two parts. The one is high-level tasks and the other is low-level tasks.

High-level tasks include image recognition, image classification, video understanding and analysis, semantic segmentation and so on. Low-level tasks include image restoration, image enhancement, image denoising, image deblurring, image super resolution and so on. For high-level tasks, we need to let computers think like human. They need to analyze the images or videos. For low-level tasks, implementations are like Digital Image Processing. We focus more on image quality and we may concentrate less on figuring out what is included in an image or video.
