# Super Resolution

Super Resolution(SR) belongs to low-level task in CV.

For image SR, we aim to super resolve the low resolution input to high SR output.

Image above shows the process of SR, which also presents ill-posed feature of this technique. This feature comes from information deficiency. Obviously, we need to restore more information than information provided in the original image. 

As for the history of SR, to the best of my knowledge, I cannot assert who is the first one coming up with this idea. But I can say [Thomas Shi-Tao Huang](https://grainger.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/t-huang1) is an influential pioneer in this field.



next, pending: what is sr? sr history? benchmark datasets ...
